# Distributed Chat System Setup and Implementation Plan

## Objective
- Develop a scalable, distributed chat system
- real-time communication
- custom message broker
- Tkinter-based Python GUI
- system will support multiple users, chat rooms
---


## Running

- open terminal and cd into database and run the start_db file
- run the message broker server
- open however many terminals and run 3_test.py to do gui
- or run main.py file


## Updates

- a list box under active users of rooms that are currently in use and then a user can click that room and switch to it that way as opposed to having to know the room number ahead of time
- when switching rooms, the chat should clear and new history loaded in
- rooms be password projected
- setting up user database and logging in



## Project Assessment
- first time using many things in this project: database, async functions, websockets, etc
- the project is not something anyone would want to use but the trade-off was that I learned a lot
